# How to Use

## About Proxies


You can add proxy lists in the `proxies.txt` file, and the proxy format is as follows:

If there is authentication:

Format:

```
protocol://user:password@hostname:port
```

Example:

```
http://admin:admin@69.69.69.69:6969
```

If there is no authentication:

Format:

```
protocol://hostname:port
```

Example:

```
http://69.69.69.69:6969
```

Please pay close attention to whether the proxy you are using requires authentication or not, as many people DM me asking about how to use proxies.


## Termux

1. Make sure your device has Python and Git installed.

    Recommendation: Use Python version 3.8+ (3.8 or newer)
   
   Python
   ```shell
   pkg install python3

   Git
   ```shell
   pkg install git
   ```

   ```

4. Install the required modules/libraries.
   ```
   python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. Edit the `data.txt` file, enter your query data into the `data.txt` file. One line for 1 account, if you want to add a 2nd account, fill it in on a new line.

You can add more and run the accounts in turn by entering a query id in new line like this:
